                    Whether it is playing video games, surfing the internet, 
                    or compiling code, my passion has always been for computers 
                    and technology. That passion has ultimately led me to decide 
                    on my dream career, software engineering. To achieve this goal,
                    I plan on first taking all the engineering courses offered by 
                    my high school that will allow me to develop my knowledge about 
                    computer science and engineering as a whole. Then, I hope to 
                    attend a well-known engineering college such as University of 
                    California, Berkeley, and graduate with a masters degree in
                    computer science to build a path towards becoming a successful 
                    software engineer. Software engineering brings out the talents 
                    and abilities within me and puts them to good use, while 
                    allowing me to to express myself in a unique way.</p>
                    <p style="text-indent: 3em; text-align:left; color: white;">    
                    I have observed that in the world of software engineering, the three 
                    paramount qualities required to be successful are being innovative, 
                    open-minded, and persistent. I have developed these traits in the 
                    experiences I have faced over the years. I enjoy creating works of 
                    art and playing piano as it brings forth my creativity and musical ability.
                    Sports have also played a huge role in letting me explore and discover
                    more about myself. I have spent hours and hours of training in swimming 
                    and badminton, and recently I have started to play golf.
                    The major accomplishments that I have achieved throughout my life also reflect these traits. 
                    My most memorable accomplishment was passing the Certificate of Merit Level 10 piano test. 
                    It required daily practice and continuous persistence over the course of ten years to finally 
                    achieve this goal.</p>
                    <p style="text-indent: 3em; text-align:left; color: white;">  
                    There are many soft skills that I have gained throughout my life that will 
                    assist me in the future such as teamwork and problem solving. In one of my
                    most recent work experiences, I had to work out plans with other volunteers
                    to clean up community parks throughout the city of Milpitas. I was able to
                    collaborate very well with my team members solved many problems such as using
                    time efficiently and acquiring tools to speed up the process. I learned from
                    this experience that I was a very open-mined person as I was eager to accept 
                    the ideas of others instead sticking to my own ideas.
                    I also have a strong set of working skills including proficiency in the HTML, 
                    CSS, Python, and Java programming languages which will aid me in becoming a 
                    successful software engineer. Thank you for your time and feel free to explore 
                    the rest of my site.</p>
